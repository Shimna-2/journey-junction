      <h1>Essay on Flavours of Wayanad</h1>
    </header>

    <main>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Wayanad, the green paradise of Kerala, is not just known for its misty
        mountains and lush forests, but also for its rich culinary legacy. The
        flavours of Wayanad are deeply rooted in its tribal traditions, organic
        farming, and abundant spices. From earthy tribal dishes to aromatic
        Kerala-style feasts, Wayanad’s cuisine is a delicious journey through
        tradition, health, and nature.
      </p>

      <h2>Traditional Tribal Dishes</h2>
      <p>
        The tribal communities of Wayanad—such as the Paniyas, Kurumas, and
        Kattunayakans—have developed a unique food culture based on locally
        available forest produce. Their diet consists of tubers, wild greens,
        bamboo rice, and river fish. Some popular tribal dishes include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Bamboo Rice Payasam:</strong> A sweet dish made with bamboo
          seeds, coconut milk, and jaggery.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Kaatan Kozhi Curry:</strong> Spicy wild chicken curry cooked
          with tribal spices.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Meen Thoran:</strong> Dry fish sautéed with grated coconut,
          onions, and curry leaves.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Spice Legacy</h2>
      <p>
        Wayanad is one of India’s leading spice-growing regions. Black pepper,
        cardamom, clove, and nutmeg dominate the landscape. These spices are not
        only exported globally but are also essential in the local cuisine. Most
        dishes are spiced naturally, avoiding artificial additives. The aroma of
        freshly ground spices from local kitchens is an experience in itself.
      </p>

      <h2>Kerala Staples with a Wayanad Twist</h2>
      <p>
        Wayanad shares many culinary staples with the rest of Kerala but adds
        its own mountain charm. Rice is the staple grain, served with a variety
        of curries and side dishes. Meals often include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Puttu and Kadala:</strong> Steamed rice flour cakes served
          with black chickpea curry.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Appam and Stew:</strong> Fermented rice pancakes with creamy
          coconut-based vegetable or meat stew.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Avial:</strong> A mixed vegetable curry with coconut and curry
          leaves, traditionally served on banana leaves.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Wild and Organic Ingredients</h2>
      <p>
        Wayanad is a stronghold of organic farming. Locals prefer fresh
        ingredients, hand-picked from farms or forests. Jackfruit, banana stem,
        colocasia leaves, wild honey, and medicinal herbs are often part of
        their daily meals. Many dishes are not only flavorful but also deeply
        nourishing and aligned with Ayurveda.
      </p>

      <h2>Modern Takes & Culinary Tourism</h2>
      <p>
        In recent years, Wayanad has witnessed a culinary evolution. Many
        homestays and resorts now offer curated food experiences, from
        tribal-style bamboo cooking to spice-infused fusion dishes. Culinary
        tours, spice garden walks, and local cooking sessions are growing in
        popularity among tourists who want to taste and learn.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        The flavours of Wayanad are more than just food—they are a story of the
        land and its people. Rooted in tradition, enhanced by nature, and guided
        by health, Wayanad’s cuisine reflects a lifestyle that is slow,
        sustainable, and soulful. For anyone visiting this green jewel of
        Kerala, tasting its authentic food is as essential as exploring its
        scenic hills.
