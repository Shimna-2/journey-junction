      <h1>Climate of Wayanad</h1>
    </header>

    <main>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Wayanad, a district in the northeastern part of Kerala, is a haven of
        biodiversity and scenic beauty. Situated in the lap of the Western Ghats
        at an altitude ranging from 700 to 2100 meters above sea level, Wayanad
        enjoys a unique climate throughout the year. This hill district is
        characterized by cool temperatures, high rainfall, and lush greenery,
        making it one of the most visited tourist destinations in South India.
      </p>

      <h2>Geographical Influence on Climate</h2>
      <p>
        Wayanad's geographical location is central to its climate. The Western
        Ghats act as a natural barrier, attracting heavy clouds and resulting in
        significant rainfall. The terrain, dominated by hills, valleys, and
        dense forests, maintains a moderate temperature and high humidity. The
        altitude plays a critical role in keeping the area cooler than other
        parts of Kerala.
      </p>

      <h2>Seasons in Wayanad</h2>

      <h3>‚òÄÔ∏è Summer (March to May)</h3>
      <p>
        Summers in Wayanad are surprisingly pleasant. Unlike the scorching heat
        in many other parts of India, Wayanad's summer temperature rarely
        crosses 35¬∞C. Early mornings and evenings are cool, while midday can be
        moderately warm. Tourists often enjoy nature trails, tea estates, and
        pre-monsoon trekking during this period.
      </p>

      <h3>üåßÔ∏è Monsoon (June to September)</h3>
      <p>
        The monsoon season transforms Wayanad into a mystical landscape.
        Rainfall is heavy, especially during July and August, sometimes
        exceeding 3000 mm annually. Dense mist covers the hills, and waterfalls
        like Meenmutty and Soochipara surge with power. Though monsoons may pose
        travel challenges due to slippery roads and occasional landslides, they
        are a visual and spiritual treat for rain lovers.
      </p>

      <h3>‚ùÑÔ∏è Winter (October to February)</h3>
      <p>
        Winter is considered the best time to visit Wayanad. Temperatures can
        drop as low as 10¬∞C at night while staying between 20‚Äì25¬∞C during the
        day. The skies remain clear, making it ideal for sightseeing, camping,
        wildlife safaris in Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary, and honeymoon getaways.
        The famous Edakkal Caves and Banasura Sagar Dam are popular attractions
        in this serene season.
      </p>

      <h2>Impact on Biodiversity</h2>
      <p>
        The climate of Wayanad supports a rich variety of flora and fauna. The
        consistent rainfall and mild temperatures provide perfect conditions for
        tropical rainforests. The region is home to elephants, leopards, tigers,
        langurs, and hundreds of bird species. Spices like pepper, cardamom, and
        coffee thrive here, making agriculture one of the major occupations in
        the region.
      </p>

      <h2>Climate and Lifestyle</h2>
      <p>
        The tribal and local communities in Wayanad have built their lifestyle
        around the climate. Traditional homes are built using mud and bamboo,
        designed to stay cool during summers and resist dampness during
        monsoons. Farming cycles are aligned with seasonal rains, and festivals
        like Onam and Vishu reflect the agricultural rhythm of the region.
      </p>

      <h2>Eco-Tourism and Climate</h2>
      <p>
        Wayanad‚Äôs climate plays a vital role in promoting eco-tourism. The calm
        and cool atmosphere, along with the scenic beauty, attracts thousands of
        tourists every month. Many resorts and homestays are now built using
        sustainable practices, preserving the natural environment. Guided treks,
        forest walks, and tea plantation tours are common eco-friendly
        attractions.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
